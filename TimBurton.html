    <p>One day in the park<br />
      I had quite a surprise <br />   
      I met a girl <br />
      who had many eyes. <br />
      <br />
       She was really quite pretty <br />
       (and also quite shocking!) <br />
       and I noticed she had a mouth, <br />
       so we ended up talking. <br />
       <br />
       We talked about flowers, <br />
       her poetry classes <br />
       and the problems she’d have <br />
       if she ever wore glasses. <br />
       <br />

      It’s great to know a girl <br />
      who has so many eyes, <br />
      but you really get wet <br />
      when she breaks down and cries.</p>
